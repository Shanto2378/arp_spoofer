# This is a hobby/learning project developed in Python

# Usecase
Using this code you can spoof a target to get all the packets though you and the to the router. It's called arp spoofing. This way you can read all the packets Ex: "Username, Password, Images" that are sent throught the target machine. This means you are the Man in the middle of the target machine and the router. The target machine will think you are the router and the router will think you are the target. **Please see the example code for better understanding**

# Example Code
+ sudo python3 arp_spoofer.py -t "Target IP" -g "Gateway IP"

# Thank you.
